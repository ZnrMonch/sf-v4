The system will allow basic e-commerce transactions between customers and admins like purchasing and selling products while securing user data. Asides from the basic features and functionalities that are present on a typical e-commerce system, there are also security features implemented in this study. Security features that are included in this study is Multi-Factor Authentication and bcrypt. Multi-Factor Authentication is a standard security feature implemented on most systems and software applications, it works by verifying the authenticity of a user by requesting a unique one-time pin or OTP sent to their email account upon registering on the system. On the other hand, Bcrypt\\\'s purpose is to secure data stored in the backend of applications by using a cryptographic hash function that turns a user\\\'s password into a specific number characters unrecognizable to its original form. The system will be evaluated by using ISO 25010 Product Quality Model Evaluation that assesses a system or software application based on a specific criterion. In this study, the system will be evaluated based on its functionality suitability, interaction capability, reliability, security, and maintainability by three groups. Each group is composed of 10 individuals which are e-commerce platform users, PAKISAMA employees, and IT specialists.
