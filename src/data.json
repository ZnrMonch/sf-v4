The system consists of calculating bounding boxes to check the formatting of CS thesis papers, providing a valuable tool for students and professors to efficiently review and reduce formatting errors. The method involves calculating PDF paper size, margins, spacings and defining fonts. Using Tesseract OCR and PyMuPDF, the system extracts text details, detects margins, and calculates text spacings. The model detects the errors by highlighting them with OpenCV specifically fonts, margins, and spacing. Despite difficulties in manual data extraction and time-consuming margin and spacing detection, the developed system proves useful in improving UMak CS Thesis Manuscript formatting, resulting with an overall accuracy rate of 90.66% across various formatting components specifically: margin, spacings, and font-related, with a potential for future refinements. Furthermore, the system evaluation reached an overall rating of 3.55, indicating a general acceptance among Computer Science (CS) students and professors.",

            "abstract": "This capstone project proposes a comprehensive Zero Trust Network Architecture (ZTNA) solution to strengthen the security posture of Micro Image International Corporation (MIC). The project addresses the growing security concerns of MIC in light of recent cyber threats. ZTNA significantly improves over traditional perimeter-based security by enforcing continuous authentication of users and devices throughout network sessions. This approach minimizes the potential impact of security breaches by assuming all entities (users, devices, applications) are untrusted. The ZTNA solution leverages Cisco Duo for multi-factor authentication (MFA), adding an extra layer of security to user logins and restricting unauthorized access. Granular access control further tightens security by limiting access to authorized resources only. The solution also encompasses a secure Wide Area Network (WAN) connection for secure data exchange with sister companies. This WAN connection utilizes Fortinet FortiGate firewalls and Site-to-Site VPN to ensure robust data protection. The firewalls provide additional security features like application control, user authentication, and web filtering. The project recommends a phased approach with user training, security policy reviews, and ongoing threat detection practices to ensure successful implementation. The project also emphasizes the importance of vendor selection and equipment compatibility assessment. By implementing the proposed TNA solution and secure W",

Over the past decade, various solutions have been proposed, each aiming to enhance efficiency and reduce time consumption. However, each individual system has its own flaws and errors. With the emergence of hyflex learning and the social issues it presents in onsite and virtual classes, the lack of familiarity can lead to challenges in effectively tracking attendance and addressing the specific needs of this environment. This study introduces a new approach to attendance systems in hyflex learning using modern techniques,\nspecifically machine learning. The researchers utilized the pre-trained SSD MobileNet V1, a convolutional neural network-based model, to create a face recognition model by applying transfer learning techniques. During the development of the model, face images and face annotations were gathered as part of the data collection process serving as the target training data for validation and testing. After the model was developed, the researchers created a web application called APyro using the agile methodology approach and implemented the trained model along with the developed system. The system and the models were evaluated using different metrics. The overall outcome of the system addressed specific social issues in the hyflex modality, offering a potential solution to some challenges faced in attendance tracking in this setting.",
