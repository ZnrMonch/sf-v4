The method involves calculating PDF paper size, margins, spacings and defining fonts. Using Tesseract OCR and PyMuPDF, the system extracts text details, detects margins, and calculates text spacings. The model detects the errors by highlighting them with OpenCV specifically fonts, margins, and spacing. Despite difficulties in manual data extraction and time-consuming margin and spacing detection, the developed system proves useful in improving UMak CS Thesis Manuscript formatting, resulting with an overall accuracy rate of 90.66% across various formatting components specifically: margin, spacings, and font-related, with a potential for future refinements. Furthermore, the system evaluation reached an overall rating of 3.55, indicating a general acceptance among Computer Science (CS) students and professors.",

Traditionally, the processing of essential documents such as barangay certificates, certificates of indigency, barangay clearances, business permits, and blotter complaints has been handled manually, resulting in long lines and congestion. This project aims to address these challenges by automating and digitizing the procedures in the barangay. The proponents introduced hard-coded security features to protect against malicious users and safeguard sensitive matters within the barangay. To further enhance convenience and ease of access, physical hardware like kiosks will be positioned thoughtfully around the barangay. \"The researchers hope to increase worker productivity and enhance resident satisfaction by putting the Skybarangay system into place. To guarantee the system's success, a test plan was established, and an evaluation was carried out with IT professionals, residents, and employees. The evaluation findings revealed a \"\"High\"\" of satisfaction, with a mean score of 3.3. This encouraging feedback demonstrates the Skybarangay system's effectiveness in increasing barangay efficiency and improving resident service quality. In conclusion, the Skybarangay system is a huge step forward for Barangay Western Bicutan, providing a more modern and efficient method to handling critical barangay services.\"",

            "abstract": "This capstone project proposes a comprehensive Zero Trust Network Architecture (ZTNA) solution to strengthen the security posture of Micro Image International Corporation (MIC). The project addresses the growing security concerns of MIC in light of recent cyber threats. ZTNA significantly improves over traditional perimeter-based security by enforcing continuous authentication of users and devices throughout network sessions. This approach minimizes the potential impact of security breaches by assuming all entities (users, devices, applications) are untrusted. The ZTNA solution leverages Cisco Duo for multi-factor authentication (MFA), adding an extra layer of security to user logins and restricting unauthorized access. Granular access control further tightens security by limiting access to authorized resources only. The solution also encompasses a secure Wide Area Network (WAN) connection for secure data exchange with sister companies. This WAN connection utilizes Fortinet FortiGate firewalls and Site-to-Site VPN to ensure robust data protection. The firewalls provide additional security features like application control, user authentication, and web filtering. The project recommends a phased approach with user training, security policy reviews, and ongoing threat detection practices to ensure successful implementation. The project also emphasizes the importance of vendor selection and equipment compatibility assessment. By implementing the proposed TNA solution and secure W",

The University of Makati was established in 1972, with the envisioned school as an instrument that provides University Education to mold Makati youth as productive citizens. School Safety and Security is crucial for the University to secure important information or data of employee staff and especially the Professors and Students. On top of that, to secure and protect all the technologies, which are the devices of the Professors and Students inside the University. In colleges and universities, the lack of an efficient visitor management system presents a worrying vulnerability, resulting in the unauthorized entry of intruders who may take advantage of the surveillance gap to steal valuable assets. To address the issue, the developers suggest digitizing the visitor handling process and making it more effective with a Web-App that is not only accessible on the Internet but is also responsive to mobile devices.    To Develop a web-based application with Super Admin, Admin, and Visitors as the Main Users. However, in the system, there is a Privileged Account that can create admin accounts, print records of Visitor Information, and have an Auto Archive in their Dashboard. Admin Accounts with Little Privilege such as decrypting the visitor's information and approval of the Registration.",
